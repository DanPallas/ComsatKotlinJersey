## An example http server using kotlin and quasar's non blocking fibers

This is just a quick example of a bare-bones http server using kotlin, quasar non blocking fibers, jackson for json, and a jersey servlet running on an embedded jetty instance without a line of xml. I wrote it mostly for my own benefit because I couldn't find any examples online. I'm uploading it with the hope that it will help someone else.
   
The project can be run with
 
 ```./gradlew run```
